  <h2>Basic components of ICS(Industrial Control System)</h2>
  <p>Control loop – control loop has sensors for measurement and they have controller hardware like PLC, actuators, control valves, breakers, switches, and motors. The controlled variable is transmitted to the controller from the sensors.</p>Human-machine interface – operators and engineers do the configuration of set-points control algorithms and establish parameters in the controller. The HMI displays the process status information.
  <h2>The control components in an ICS</h2>
  <p2>Control server – this provides the control software for DCS or PLC which is designed to communicate with lower-level control devices.
<h2>SCADA server or master control unit</h2>
<p2> SCADA server acts as the master In the SCADA system, remote terminal units and PLC devises which are located at remote field sites act as slaves.
<h2>Remote terminal unit</h2> 
<p2>These are designed to support SCADA remote stations, it is a special-purpose data acquisition and control unit. RTU’s are used to support remote situations where wire-based communications are unavailable.
<h2>Programmable logic controller</h2>
<p2>PLC is a small industrial computer that is designed to perform the logic functions executed by electrical hardware. PLC has the ability to control complex process and they are used in SCADA systems and DCS. PLC’s can be used as a field device because they are more economical and flexible.
<h2>Distributed control systems</h2> <p2>DCS can handle multiple automation processes in a factory, it can control all the automation or it can monitor or supervise the factory process.
<h2>Piping system:Within industry</h2> <p2>Piping is a system of pipes used to convey fluids from one location to another. The engineering discipline of piping design studies the efficient transport of fluid. Industrial process piping can be manufactured from wood, fiberglass, glass, steel, aluminum, plastic, copper, and concrete.<p>
Requirements of Piping system</p>
<p2>All instrument piping system or tubing runs should be routed to meet the following requirements:
<p>They should be kept as short as possible.
<p>They should not cause any obstruction that would prohibit personnel or traffic access.
<p>They should not interfere with other equipment items ‘ accessibility for maintenance.
<p>They should avoid potential fire risk areas or hot environments.
<p>They should be located with sufficient clearance to allow lagging on adjacent pipework that may be required.
<p>The number of joints should be kept to a minimum consistent with good practice.
<p>All piping and tubing from supports attached to firm steelworks or structures (not handrails) should be adequately supported along its entire length.
<h2>Valves:-</h2> 
<p2>A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category.
<p>Types of valves used in petrochemical industry
<p>1.Start/stop the flow of the fluid (hydrocarbons, oil & gas, steam, water, acids) through the pipeline (example: gate valve, ball valve, butterfly valve, knife gate valve, or plug valve)
<p>2.Modulate the flow of the fluid through the pipeline (example: globe valve)
<p>3.Control the flow of the fluid (control valve)
<p>4.Change the direction of the flow (for example a 3-way ball valve)
<p>5.Regulate the pressure of a process (pressure reducing valve)
<p>6.Protect a piping system or a device (pump, motor, tank) from overpressures (safety or pressure relief) or back-pressures (check valve)
<p>7.Filter debris flowing through a pipeline, to protect equipment that may be damaged by solid parts (y and basket strainers)
<h2>Control Measurement</h2>
</p>Pressure Measurement:-Many oil, gas and petrochemical processes are undertaken at specific pressures. Pressure is measured by pressure sensors (PE) which are arranged to transmit pressure (PT) signals to pressure controllers (PIC). Pressure vessels and tanks are also usually provided with local pressure indicators (PI).Pressure in the petrochemical industry is frequently controlled by maintaining a constant pressure in the upper gas space of a vessel.The controller (PIC) adjusts the setting on a pressure control valve (PCV) that feeds gas forward to the next stage of the process. A rising pressure in the vessel results in the PCV opening to feed more gas forward. If the pressure continues to rise some controllers then act to open a second PCV that feeds excess gas to the flare system.
</p>Temperature measurement:-The areas where temperature is to be measured fall into two main categories – vessels and pipelines. Temperature measurement in vessels vary greatly in type, ranging from traditional thermometers mounted in thermo-wells through multipoint measurement systems to cable-type thermometers mounted on pipe bundles within the vessel with connection heads mounted on the outside of the vessel. Pipeline temperature measurement is largely performed by traditional thermometers mounted within thermo-wells.
</p>Flow Measurement:-Due to the extreme process conditions and the high requirements for reliability in refineries, most flow measuring points are still conventionally fitted with wetted mechanical measuring equipment which works according to Bernoulli's pressure difference principle. However, even these simple and supposedly sound measuring instruments have been prone to malfunction and are potential sources of danger in practice.A particular difficulty involved in the measurement process in all refineries is the flow measurement of heavy crude oil fractions. These highly viscous hydrocarbon mixtures, which must be heated to temperatures above 350°C, so that they can remain capabale of flowing, often block the thin impulse lines of differential pressure meters. This results in extensive maintenance costs with associated downtimes of plant sections.
</p>Level Measurement:- Level measurements are necessary to control the amount of oil in the tank and to prevent overflow. To measure the level, non-contact radar level sensors are used. Level sensors which come in contact with the crude oil can fail because crude oil can be very viscous, especially during cold winters. Furthermore, the contacting element often requires maintenance.
